# 2017 Steamworks

Gradle - Better build system with plugins and tasks, WAY better than ANT

KnightLib - A collection of libraries and tools commonly used in J4FRC

Adaptive Pure Pursuit Controller (Better than Spline pre-generated paths from 2016)- I implemented a path following control method used in the NavLab 2 and more. All wheel speeds where computed on the spot and used the built in Feed-Forward + PID control system in the Talon SRX

Auto Command Arch - Action based queue, where you can run an action and the next wont execute until the next is done.
